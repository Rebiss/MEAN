MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

The **MEAN** stack is MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

**MongoDB:** MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.

**Express.js:** Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js.

**Angular.js:** JavaScript MVC frameworks that run in browser JavaScript engines.

**Node.js:** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
